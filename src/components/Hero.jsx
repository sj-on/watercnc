      <p>yeah, that's right. costumers. we love putting words into our costumers mouths. (because that's what everyone else does too, duh!) and we don't even try to do things differently because we are not unlike them. we are the opposite of those quirky and relatable, manic pixie dream girls!</p>
      <p>we embrace the fact that we are unoriginal and take pride in being so. (this way we are being honest to our costumers, admitting all of this stuff. some people won't even do that!)</p>
      <p>we are a generic brand. and there is nothing more generic than us in this world. that's our speciality. that's what parts us from others. what makes *you* different than others? tell us in the comments below. (spoiler alert: there's no comment section here. ha ha. mapril fools!)</p>
